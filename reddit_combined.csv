comment,m0jlqmn,t1_m0evkw5,kittywheezes,AnnArbor,,"I think Church Street works because its central to a dense and already walkable city. It is part of the main shopping/commercial area of the city and city hall opens right onto it (with the park literally right there, too). Small New England cities are pretty condensed; if you're going to hit up the farmers market at the park, may as well walk down church street and check it out. Stop by a brewery around the corner, head down to the lakefront. An able bodied person doesn't need a car or even a bus pass to see the city in a day. Its honestly more of a pain to drive than walk.

That's said, there are a few pedestrian streets/alleys in Detroit that are really lovely, so they can work in bigger cities, too. I was just at Columbia Street next to the Fox Theater and it reminded me a lot of church street. Maybe the difference is that both are often people's final destinations and dont require car traffic to drive business. I think pedestrian malls can add a lovely sense of place and community, and their value isn't just commercial. Its a shame so many have failed.

Im obviously biased because I absolutely loved living in Burlington. But theres lots to think about here!",1,,1733409757.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1h6brv5/some_want_pedestrian_malls_in_downtown_ann_arbor/m0jlqmn/,post4.json
comment,m0evkw5,t1_m0et848,Mezmorki,AnnArbor,,"Yes.  Kalamzoo Mall north of Michigan Ave is still a fully closed to vehicles ped mall and it's far less active than the part you mention to the south.

Pearl Street and Church Streets mentioned above are both in cold climates with snow.  I've been to Church street in the winter time and there is a constant level of programming (ice sculptures, music, lights, etc.) to keep it active and vibrant feeling, and even then it seems to struggle at times.

I'm fully on board with the need to improve pedestrian comfort, widen sidewalks, manage vehicle speeds, etc. but that doesn't require jumping all the way up ""make it a ped mall!"" to have a major impact.  5th Street in Kerrytown, First &amp; Liberty, etc. are examples of pedestrian-centric street design changes that still allow vehicles but are vastly more comfortable for pedestrians than they were.  The circulation study looks to recommending a lot more of those types of treatments too.",7,,1733339032.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1h6brv5/some_want_pedestrian_malls_in_downtown_ann_arbor/m0evkw5/,post4.json

comment,m0dgvhd,t3_1h6brv5,PrimaryDue609,AnnArbor,,"This is a complex topic, and there are a few things to consider:

1. Most pedestrian malls that have been built across the U.S. have failed (i.e. not attracted enough commercial activity to support the businesses better than before the conversion).  Where it has been successful, e.g. Church Street in Burlington VT or Pearl St. Mall in Boulder, CO, there are entire organizations devoted to programming, maintaining, marketing events, brokering commercial tenants into the space (literally like you would for an interior mall).  You don't just close the street and redesign it and call it a day.

The article is sparse on the details that are needed to make pedestrian malls successful.  And from my understanding, the downtown merchant associations (e.g. Main Street and State Street, two separate associations) do not have the capacity or desire to provide that level of support, the Main Street BIZ (business improvement zone) doesn't have the capacity/resources, and neither does the City (through either the DDA or the Parks Department, etc.).  

Which leads the recommendation cited in the article...

2. Redesigning Liberty Street as a ""flexible street"" , which would presumably include provisions for installation of removable or retractable bollards, narrowing the drive lane areas, widening sidewalks, etc. that would make transitioning Liberty into a full Pedestrian Mall in the future significantly easier. Much of the infrastructure cost of designing the street as a pedestrian mall could be done in advance, and would provide better flexibility for events and intermittent pedestrianization in the short term while other needs (programming, etc.) come on line later to support a ped mall.

3. And... as much as we might wish for personal vehicles to diminish in their importance, until infrastructure is built to support a significant enough mode shift to get more people riding the bus, walking, and biking, cars are part of the fabric.  The circulation study mentioned in the article also proposes a number of other significant street changes, including provisions for transit lanes on Huron to support AAATA's proposed BRT routes, transit lanes north across broadway bridge, additional separated bikeway connections into the downtown, etc.  These improvements are also competing for roadway space. 

So creating capacity in the network for things like permanent pedestrian malls need to be coordinated with other improvements that make other modes of travel more attractive and viable for people.  It may be that certain improvements, like BRT, need to come online first and create capacity in the network that will allow other things, like ped malls, to be more viable and ultimately successful.   

Of course, continuing to increase the supply of housing and density downtown and near downtown is also really important for reducing vehicle traffic (less people needing to commute into town for example) and creating more walkable / bikeable / transit-friendly spaces.",61,,1733323360.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1h6brv5/some_want_pedestrian_malls_in_downtown_ann_arbor/m0dgvhd/,post4.json

post,w0iqiu,,computational-unit,AnnArbor,Walkability outside of downtown,"Hey Ann Arbor people, I wanted to ask a question for you all. I have been considering a move with a friend of mine to Ann Arbor. We took a trip out a few weeks ago, and loved it to where we have gotten to where the two of us have started looking at apartments. We were hoping to get something near the Old West Side (where we stayed during our trip) but a lot of those seem out of our price range. A lot of the places we are looking at are further from downtown. My question is how walkable would you say that the areas further from downtown, but within the city limits, are? I didn't spend a lot of time out there, but it seemed like most places did have sidewalks for the most part. Just wanted to get some thoughts of residents.

But more specific to your question, unless you really love walking and don't mind the heat you're going to be hard-pressed to keep up with walking anything more than the immediate area where you live.  Summers and winters can be brutal in this state; besides the crippling humidity in the summers, winters carry their own issues - that is, owners quite often don't shovel their sidewalks.  The application can be uneven.  Yes, you can call the city to speak to the property owner (which I availed myself of several times), but that still doesn't change the fact that you're immediately inconvenienced in the moment.

the bus system here is okay at best, compared to other places i've lived that are comparable in population, area, and cost of living. i often wonder if the people that say the bus system is great actually utilize it in a manner where they're dependent on it.   i'm sure it'd be better, but given so many people driving short distances here, it is under utilized.  but it's doable, if you really plan your trips.   


as far as how walk-able ann arbor is, that kinda depends on your level of fitness and distance.  i'd say most of the city is walk-able.  one thing i've done when figuring out a new walking / biking route , is use google maps set it to satellite view so i can see if there are bike lanes and or sidewalks.   i've gone on several 10 mile walks in the city and haven't encountered to many non-side walk areas, but they do exist.

Within easy walk with good sidewalks: three parks, two coffee shops, a half dozen restaurants, Patengill Elementary School (grades 3-5), a barbershop, a good convenience store, a synagogue, a music store and a karate studio.

In easy biking distance (under 2 miles):  many more restaurants and parks, a good small hardware store, Trader Joes and two small fruit and vegetable stores, a library branch, a pharmacy and two thrift stores. Still very bikeable (2-4 miles): Central campus, all of downtown, Briarwood Mall and several strip malls, and schools covering the entire K-12 age range. Technically, Costco is also at that distance, though I've never tried it. Plus buses to downtown every 15 minutes.

About the only things we need a car to get to are big box stores (Target, Meijer, Kroger, Home Depot) and, ironically, a good bike shop.",1,,1658454102.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/w0iqiu/walkability_outside_of_downtown/ih4swgo/,post8.json

We are hoping to get a house that’s walkable (we have dogs we walk a few miles each day) and has a few walkable amenities around, like a coffee shop. My dream is also to be able to bike commute to U of M hospital campus for work. 

Other info: We both love hiking and the outdoors. We would like to stay in relatively quiet neighborhoods (no undergrads) if possible, and our budget will be ~350k-400k depending.

post,8o9cad,,Anyname_Jane,AnnArbor,Will I be miserable w/out a car?,"Young professional here, not a student, Michigan native but new to Ann Arbor. I'll be moving in the late summer for a one-year gig.

The timing works out that my current car lease ends just after I'll be moving to ann arbor. I've never not had a vehicle-even when I lived in DC. The original plan was to buy out my lease, but now my life is a bit less settled and I may be moving around quite a bit for the next few years.

So, I'm considering swapping the costs of a car/insurance/parking for higher rent in the city- walking to work and walking/biking/busing elsewhere. 

I'll be traveling to kalamazoo and Chicago occasionally, but I'm good with the train for that. I'd also like to take a couple trips to Detroit, so I imagone the occasional rental car may be in order.

Is this a terrible plan? Will I be trudging through two feet of snow on uncleared sidewalks and paying through the nose for groceries within walking/busing distance of downtown?

comment,e01qwhr,t3_8o9cad,bubblingbeebles,AnnArbor,,"I've lived in the north and worked in the south without a car for a couple years now. Definitely doable!

Pros:

You will most likely get an unlimited bus pass if you are working near downtown. 

Nice not to deal with all the potholes and car problems caused by potholes...

Might not be the best biking city at first glance, but with some planning and experience you can make for a beautiful and low\-traffic commute! See if you can integrate the east\-west\-ish B2B trail into your commute.

It may seem like a bummer to stand at a bus stop in a blizzard, until you realize you don't have to drive in it. 

We have tons of grocery stores on main bus routes/walking distance whatever side of town you are on. 

The train goes to Detroit as well as Chicago. I've never used it for Detroit though.

Cons:

Occasionally the busses will miss the transfer downtown if you had a planned transfer. Outskirt busses are usually the ones that would be late, but major busses like the 3 or the 4 are 100&amp;#37; reliable. 

Busses run way less on weekends. Though we are slowly adding more routes and times every year.",19,,1528045905.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/8o9cad/will_i_be_miserable_wout_a_car/e01qwhr/,post5.json

comment,e0600by,t1_e01z502,jbfields,AnnArbor,,"My wife and I have lived in Ann Arbor since 1994 and only finally got a car last year.  It's entirely doable, and I've got no regrets, and I suspect we saved a lot of money (though I've never done a careful comparison taking into account housing costs).  If anything it's gotten easier, thanks to more delivery options, and to Uber, Lyft, Zipcar, and Maven.

Agreed with others that groceries can be an annoyance, and I don't entirely agree here:

""If it is hard to live without a car here, it would also be hard to live in (say) most of Portland or Seattle.""

Moving to Ann Arbor from Portland in 1994, the main shock was the distribution of retail: everywhere I'd lived in Portland had a Safeway or Fred Meyer within a few blocks, while in Ann Arbor there's nothing really comparable downtown, which is increasingly all restaurants and entertainment.  Of course my Portland experience is pretty dated!  Also, there are more delivery options now.  And also there *is* some stuff downtown (some smaller stores, a small farmer's market).

The transit certainly isn't as good a big city's, but it's still useful (possibly in combination with ride services).

""My advice, if the areas adjacent to downtown prove out of reach, would be to consider somewhere off of Plymouth or Stadium.""

Agreed.  We're currently near Nixon &amp; Plymouth--easy access to Kroger, AAATA and UM bus lines, and a library branch.",3,,1528226546.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/8o9cad/will_i_be_miserable_wout_a_car/e0600by/,post5.json

The roads are bikeable, the major buses are reliable, and areas adjacent to downtown are highly walkable. Getting to and from Detroit on the reg would be an issue, but you can always take the train or, as someone mentioned, the UM bus which costs ~$10 each way. My advice, if the areas adjacent to downtown prove out of reach, would be to consider somewhere off of Plymouth or Stadium. The bus lines there are highly reliable, there are tons of grocery stores in walking distance, and the bike ride into downtown would be very easy.

I've spent some time recently out west and I would say that, relative to it's size, Ann Arbor is about on par with cities in the Northwest that are ranked highly for those wishing to ditch their car.

comment,e0cds5h,t3_8o9cad,meechydark,AnnArbor,,"I lived in various parts of Ann Arbor for 4 years without a car. I definitely relished those few instances where somebody lent me their car to go shopping or finish up a project on North campus outside of bus hours, but overall I had access to everything I needed via my bike and the city and campus buses, and honestly I think not owning a car is the way to go in AA. 

If you're on two legs or two wheels, then Ann Arbor is a city of vast shortcuts. I would often race friends that were driving from one side of town to the other on my bike and win by huge margins. Parking is limited, can be expensive, and roads are poor quality. The only issue I had (besides it being annoying to carry grocery bags on a bus) was the noticeable tension that seems to exist between bikers and drivers in some areas of the city - I've seen quite a bit of near collisions and disagreements, but this is mostly anecdotal. Biking through the city itself is not always the most fun journey, but many of the parks around the outskirts of the city offer fantastic paths. I used to ride out on Pauline to Maple and back around the Eberwhite woods, or take the BTB trail to Ypsi.

comment,e0wxil9,t3_8o9cad,sellenmarie,AnnArbor,,"Hi OP! I moved from DC to Ann Arbor in January and have not had a car. I survived the winter just fine - as another poster mentioned, you quickly realize riding the bus is safer in the winter than driving. I watched multiple cars slide into the ditch at a traffic circle while waiting for the bus one extra chilly morning. And I didn’t mind waiting in the cold - the wait is about as long as it’d take to clear your car off, but the bus is already warm when you get on!

One thing I would say is since I don’t have a car, I definitely uber and order food more than the average person. This could be because it became a norm for me in DC where UberPool was super cheap (~$5 a ride) and even “regular” non-pizza/chinese restaurants deliver or are on a food delivery app. Both of these things are more costly here - Uber Pool or Lyft’s equivalent are not available here, and things are more spread out so delivery is a bit more expensive and takes much longer.

To compare commutes: In DC my morning commute was ~40 mins from Takoma Park to L’enfant Plaza (same after I moved &amp; went from Friendship Heights to L’enfant). This included about 15 mins of walking (Takoma) or 15 min bus ride (FH) and then taking two metro lines. 
In Ann Arbor my commute is ~50mins to 1hr 10mins in the morning. I go from Nixon &amp; Green down to Wolverine Tower - about as far north as you can get to about as far south as you can get in Ann Arbor before crossing into Saline. This includes a 2 min walk to the bus stop and taking two city buses (they are slightly less on time than the UM buses and I am often waiting 10 min to transfer in the morning. If I stay later than 5:30pm at work the transfer wait on the way home can add up to 25 additional mins to the commute bc the connection doesn’t line up right. I suspect this is bc not many people go from one far side of town to the other every day.

Bus vs Car: this same route to work in the morning takes about 20mins via car, although an uber or lyft is usually ~7-10mins away from my location so I try not to uber to work unless I have a meeting I can’t easily get to on time via bus (the frequency is lower for the first bus I take and it doesn’t line up right with the second. I’d have to leave by 7:30 to make it there by 9, assuming the connection is in on time)
Again, I was grateful for the bus in the winter though. My commute time didn’t really change, but it changed drastically for those who drove (a 10min drive turned into an unpredictable 30-40min commute).

Thoughts: Now that it is summer, I find myself wanting a car more. The bus summer schedule is slightly less frequent and it is not fun waiting at the transit stop in the heat. Everyone kind of hunkers down and does less in the winter, but now that the city is alive again I do feel like I am missing out a bit. I’ve been looking into leasing a car, but like you I’m torn and unsure if I want a 3 year commitment. I do spend a lot on uber, but it’s no as much as a car payment and car insurance combined.",1,,1529387146.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/8o9cad/will_i_be_miserable_wout_a_car/e0wxil9/,post5.json

comment,ndh3y84,t1_ndgw5p6,Greenhouse774,AnnArbor,,"Oh, I thought you meant this weekend.

I guess treat it like a game day though, if people will be tailgating before the concert, etc.

Yeah, I wouldn't count on being able to drive in and out from your AirBnB.  Just walk over to campus - State and Liberty, the Diag, the Michigan Union, the bell tower, South University.  Historic buildings, bistros, etc. if you're curious about U-M's legendary campus.  

Or Kerrytown might be more interesting - there are a few shops and the Ann Arbor Farmer's Market.  It's not much more of a walk past Main/Huron assuming walking is not an issue for you.  

Zingerman's famous deli is in that area; personally I find the food less than appealing but it's amusing to take a look at.  Nearby is a little Museum on Main Street about Washtenaw County history.  

Cafe Zola on Washington Street off Main has good food.  I was just there for a work lunch; our group got everything from a burger to waffles to an iceberg wedge salad to hummous and it all was well-prepared and enjoyable.  Not saying it's the finest cuisine but the service was good if you need a quick lunch or snack.  

Good luck.  You'll certainly have plenty of people watching if your BnB has a patio or balcony.

Btw if I were you I would get groceries on Friday night if you plan on supplying yourselves with beverages and snacks.  If you take I-94 from the airport to the State Street exit, which would be the logical route, there is a place called the Produce Station on State that has salads, cheese, snacks, beer, wine, etc.  [https://www.producestation.com/](https://www.producestation.com/)

If you want a more traditional store, zip west on Pauline, a street near your BnB, and turn right when you hit Stadium Blvd (Stadium curves, so you'll note it intersects with various larger streets, can be a bit confusing) and you will find Arbor Farm Market, Plum Market, Kroger, the chain drug stores, fast food, etc. not far away along that strip.  

Unless you really need something from a specific store, I wouldn't bother with the commercial strip out Stadium/Washtenaw in the other direction, it's extremely congested trafficwise and difficult to get in and out.  In a car, be west of the downtown/Michigan Stadium area.  

Good luck and have fun!",3,,1757522429.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1ndfakj/is_the_stadium_to_downtown_walkable/ndh3y84/,post3.json

post,vgooze,,brbarnett,AnnArbor,Looking for a highly walkable neighborhood in Ann Arbor area,"We are a family of 4 (36m, 33f, 4f, 2f) and have been living in Lisle, IL for the past 5 years. My wife's friends are all in the SE Michigan area and she wants to move back there since they're starting to have kids. We both went to UM and she's from Ann Arbor originally.

At the top of my Cons list is leaving the area we live in called Green Trails that, instead of front-of-home sidewalks, has \~26 miles of asphalt pathways that interconnect throughout the entire area. There are also what I consider to be a high number of parks (with playground equipment) that the girls love visiting. Whether I'm on the phone for work or taking our two girls out for a walk, I find myself walking miles a day through areas with tons of trees.

Here is a map of the area with the paths highlighted to give you an idea of the scale:

Are there any neighborhoods in Ann Arbor that are similar to this setup? We're also considering other suburbs to the Northeast of town (e.g., Plymouth, Northville), so we are willing to consider anything out in that direction as well.

If you're shopping A2, start with what you want to be walkable to. Elementary school or middle school? Groceries? Library? Parks? Then draw a circle around that on Google maps and see if you can get there easily from where you're shopping. 

If you take your time you'll be able to find something, but where exactly depends on your budget. Closer to Downtown costs more naturally.",17,,1655748319.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/vgooze/looking_for_a_highly_walkable_neighborhood_in_ann/id33byi/,post1.json

Ann Arbor has a lot of parks, both within neighbourhoods and connecting neighbourhoods. My biggest recommendation for you honestly if you're looking for that sort of walkability is to mostly look within city limits. The townships (and Plymouth, Northville, etc.) are much less walkable.

If you have the ability to, maybe try to rent for a year so you have time to acquaint yourself with the area and get to know which neighbourhoods would work best for you.

While house hunting, I was actually surprised how many areas of Ann Arbor didn't have consistent sidewalks and that felt kind of cut off. I have a small dog, and sidewalks/walkable areas were a priority.

It has a loop of three miles around the neighborhood, and will soon be adjacent to a new leg of the Border-to-Border trail that connects to Hudson Mills MetroPark (about nine miles to the North), and also runs back through Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti to the East.  We used to have a golf course here in Loch Alpine but it closed a few years ago.  Lots of people still walk on the old fairways.  It’s a very pretty area with hills, lakes, and many trees.  The lakes have gravel walking trails around them.  Some interesting wildlife too, including lots of deer, some snapping turtles, geese, etc.  Also close to Dexter-Huron MetroPark, Delhi MetroPark, Bird Park and the city of Dexter.

The Preserves subdivision is immediately West of us and has more expensive ($700K and up) homes if that’s of interest.  Homes in Loch Alpine generally run between $350-750k.

I see one home available here at the moment:

For winter I'd suggest getting a pair of comfortable walking boots, and some removable cleats, (ice trekkers or similar) . Some property owners do not maintain their sidewalks and it can be slippery.

City and UM buses are free to UM students. You can walk to the stadium area and pick up a campus bus in winter, or walk the 20 min to the Medical center area. You can use google maps to get routing or go to [theride.org](https://theride.org) for city bus .

post,1kgcoqb,,Awkward_Worry8300,AnnArbor,"Where to Live IN A2: Walkable, Community, Millenials","# UPDATE: Glad I Listened to Y'all 

I took your advice and prioritized budget, walkable, community, and NOT McKinley.

**The Good: Got the place under budget in great location**.

I negotiated down to $1,650 for an 1bd/1ba in Eberwhite, underbudget, close to community, walkable, and local charm.--which ended up being especially helpful because...

My car did not survive the cross country drive (no car). And I found out on day one that my boss quit, an interim was coming in two weeks, and that the last 5 times this happened, the new leader fired the person in my position to handpick their own righthand. 

Guess how my first meeting with the interim ended. 

I am staying in A2 while I apply places, in large part because so many of you went out of your way to help me and your advice is helping my emergency fund last longer (special shoutout to those of you who scouted locations and sent me private messages). 

**I cannot thank you all enough for you words of wisdom.** 

  
*P.S. If interested, I can update again once I know my next steps.*

***Original Post:***

**Grateful for Your Help: Finding My WalkableA2 Neighborhood(s)!**

Hi! I'm making the big move from California this month for work (I come in peace - just a 30-something looking for community, not a housing market villain!). After weeks of analysis paralysis, I would **love** your local expertise to find the right spot.

**My dream neighborhood checklist:**  
✅ **True walkability** \- Local coffee shops, stores, &amp; parks within a 10-minute stroll (no strip mall/parking lot deserts)  
✅ **Community vibes** \- Older areas where people gather, not downtown party crowds (I'm more ""Saturday farmers market"" than ""Saturday night bar crawl"")  
✅ **30s and single-friendly** \- Make new friends at similar life stages  
✅ **Winter-ready** \- $2K before utilities (never experienced Midwest winters heating bill)  
✅ **Grow My Roots-worthy** 

**Neighborhoods Recommended:** West Side (pre-freeway), Kerrytown, Burns Park, Bryant Pattengill-East, Eberwhite, Georgetown

**Apartments Considering:** All say they provide this, but who knows:

* AVIA Lofts, Ivanhoe ([1533 Pine Valley Boulevard, Ann Arbor, MI 48104](https://silversidemgmt.appfolio.com/listings/detail/be4f9352-c925-477e-8eb5-7a3a519fbb0e#)), and [Charlton Apartments](https://www.apartments.com/charlton-apartments-ann-arbor-mi/mkn276l/).
* Also: [Arbor Village](https://avapts.com/), [Pine Valley Apartments](https://www.apartments.com/pine-valley-apartments-ann-arbor-mi/63d3fsr/), [Avant Apartments](https://www.avantannarbor.com/floorplans?MoveInDate=05/17/2025), State Street Village, or The George (all feel way overpriced, but..)

**Would love your takes on:**

* ""Highly recommend \_\_\_\_\_\_  because."" (especially lesser-known gems)
* ""Most are out of budget, but try  \_\_\_\_\_\_  because...""
* ""Avoid \_\_\_\_\_\_ because..."" (looks walkable but isn't, bad management, frat central, etc)
* Any building community and volunteering suggestions are also greatly appreciated

comment,mr28tos,t1_mqyp1nq,EMU_Emus,AnnArbor,,"So I can't really speak to the quality of the actual living conditions of most of these places because I couldn't afford most of them while I lived in Ann Arbor and I've also moved out of Washtenaw County and closer to Detroit a couple years ago - but I grew up in Ann Arbor and went to the public schools there and lived in the area for most of my life.

AVIA Lofts - this is one of the least walkable areas in the entire city.  You'd be surrounded by a combination of highway infrastructure, industrial/commercial buildings, and a bunch of shitty chain restaurants.

Ivanhoe - this is getting on the very fringe of being able to walk to downtown.  It's still going to be a solid 15-20 minutes of walking before you're in what I would consider the walkable downtown area, but there are some cool shops sparsely populated in the neighborhood that you could totally walk to - Roos Roast has a great location around the way, and you'd be close enough to walk to York, which also has a patio, food trucks, lots of events and music and specialty food.  But it would still be super suburban feeling and you'd have to drive or bus to get to much anything else.

Charlton Apartments - this area is once again super not friendly to pedestrians.  You'd be surrounded by the strip-mall vibes and walkability is laughable.  Lots of Stroads and you'd have to walk 20+ minutes to get downtown.

Ultimately the way you should be thinking about this is that anything outside of the immediate university area is defined by Michigan's car culture.  So lots of strip malls and sprawling neighborhoods.  For most of the above, you can get by with a bike to get downtown, but if you're looking for an experience where you can step out of your door and be in an interesting place, you won't find that in any of these places you're looking.  And again, if you want that in Ann Arbor you're competing for a very very small number of housing units against a very wealthy population of international students and children of millionaires and billionaires who are attending the University of Michigan.  It's basically Brooklyn or even sometimes Manhattan prices for the kind of thing you're looking for.  Ann Arbor is very small and there just isn't much housing stock, and there's a lot of wealth competing for that limited housing stock.",2,,1746624399.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1kgcoqb/where_to_live_in_a2_walkable_community_millenials/mr28tos/,post6.json

comment,mqzofpd,t3_1kgcoqb,alphadeuceduelist,AnnArbor,,"For walkability I'd recommend you focus on the areas nearby the two Argus Farm Stops (one just West of downtown off Liberty, and one on Packard just north of Stadium) or Kerrytown.

The West side is already highly recommended. Planting yourself between Argus and Jefferson Market (which is really more a brunch spot than a market but very excellent) would put you in a nice, non-studenty area walkable to places to pick up necessities as well as very much walkable to downtown. The YMCA is nearby for your workout or swimming needs.

Charlton is a bit far from there but you have more/bigger parks, and can walk to Homes, as well as to Westgate shopping center (though the further that way you go the more you're getting into chains and parking lots.)

The other Argus Farm Stop is in Lower Burns Park, on Packard between Stadium and campus. There are students around this area (more the further North you go, naturally) but I wouldn't say they're the majority. You're walking distance not only to the Argus Farm S, Black Diesel coffee, and RelaxStation massage, Argus also has a cafe with ice cream and beer. (I am intensely jealous.)

Continuing South on Packard you get into Larrytown which is the region basically between Stadium and the Pine Valley area you've looked at. This is a tempting area, however it's a bit of a grocery desert and there aren't really any major parks. But it has York, Roos Roast roastery, Madras Masala, Frasers Pub, etc. 

Kerrytown is at the North end of downtown and contains Sparrow market, the Farmer's market, and the People's Coop. If you want to be able to walk to most of your basic needs and also to restaurants, events, and ""shops just for shopping"" this is the gold standard. Zingerman's Deli, Miss Kim, Detroit Street Filling Station, North Star Lounge and more are nearby. You probably want to look for places to rent to the west, in or near the Water Hill neighborhood (though this is probably the most expensive area of them all, for good reason.)",10,,1746581094.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1kgcoqb/where_to_live_in_a2_walkable_community_millenials/mqzofpd/,post6.json

Also, most of Ann Arbor doesn’t live downtown and so you’re likely to end up leaving downtown often to hang with whatever friends you make. 

Last thing, downtown actually pretty easy to get into from most parts of town.

comment,mr0jc2b,t3_1kgcoqb,jasonc113,AnnArbor,,"I am not familiar with the specific apartments themselves, but here is my take:

  
Ivanhoe, Pine Valley, The George- nice quiet area, not walkable to downtown, area has a few coffee shops and other small shops along Packard and also Stadium so maybe \~10min walk, Buhr park and County Farm park not too far away

Avant - area used to be ghetto 15 years ago not sure about now, not walkable to downtown, plenty of shops and restaurants on Stadium and Maple closer to Jackson but kinda strip mallish

Arbor Village- not walkable to downtown, only a few places nearby, long walk to Washtenaw/Huron shops but very strip mall area there, Washtenaw is a rush hour nightmare super busy lots of traffic, but they recently added sidewalks on both sides by county farm park (very nice park) so you could walk to the shopping areas on Washtenaw.

State street village- not walkable to downtown but there is a bus line on State street, only thing really in the area is Biercamp, you cant get to anything east easily due to the train tracks so you have to go all the way to Stadium or Eisenhower if walking, no parks nearby

  
AVIA lofts- where is this???



If you truly want walkable, you need to be close to downtown. Kerrytown is ideal, quiet and walkable but pricey. West side, anything past maybe 7th would be a long walk to downtown. Also Plymouth/Nixon area is decent, there are a lot of shops and green spaces. Most of the surrounding neighborhoods are residential near by strip mallish retail setups. AA is trying to improve the walkable neighborhoods as they have been trying to put that into their master plan for a while now. I know the Briarwood mall area is expanding a bunch and they are trying to make that more walkable now.",2,,1746592977.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1kgcoqb/where_to_live_in_a2_walkable_community_millenials/mr0jc2b/,post6.json

I took your advice and prioritized budget, walkable, community, and NOT McKinley.

**The Good: Got the place under budget in great location**.

I negotiated down to $1,650 for an 1bd/1ba in Eberwhite, underbudget, close to community, walkable, and local charm.--which ended up being especially helpful because...

My car did not survive the cross country drive (no car). And I found out on day one that my boss quit, an interim was coming in two weeks, and that the last 5 times this happened, the new leader fired the person in my position to handpick their own righthand.

Guess how my first meeting with the interim ended.

I am staying in A2 while I apply places, in large part because so many of you went out of your way to help me and your advice is helping my emergency fund last longer (special shoutout to those of you who scouted locations and sent me private messages).

comment,mqzvn7y,t3_1kgcoqb,ComprehensiveCow7024,AnnArbor,,"Lots of good comments in the thread. I'll try to add some different options without repeating what has already been said. 

If I had to move here again, near northside (just north of the river) is also a good option. There is a nucleus of amenities growing around Beekman on Broadway (Orange Market, Mini's, Lowertown Cafe and longtime stalwart Northside. The river is really nice, and about to get a lot nicer as Broadway Park West gets redeveloped and the B2B trail links are completed. It's close enough to Kerrytown for a Saturday trip to the market (though trudging home from a bar over the Broadway Bridge on a Jan night feels super bad). 

I also think the West Side out by Stadium between Jackson and Liberty is surprisingly walkable given that it gives off strip mall vibes - there is an excellent library branch, Homes, Vets Park, Bells Diner, Zal Gaz, Zingerman's Roadhouse and Stadium Hardware (the best Hardware!) along with a ton of grocery options. 

""Downtown"" is very much livable without a car, and there are lots of local (but expensive) grocery options - Knights, Sparrow, Argus etc. Although this is changing, its less of a downtown and more or a main street feeling.",1,,1746583529.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1kgcoqb/where_to_live_in_a2_walkable_community_millenials/mqzvn7y/,post6.json

post,1gneciq,,MichUrbanGardener,AnnArbor,I feel shut out of downtown,"I'm an Ann Arbor native. All my life, I've enjoyed going downtown to shop, dine, visit the library, see a movie, etc. No longer. 

I'm now a senior with mobility challenges. I can only walk a couple of blocks, and only on good days. With the emphasis on creating a ""walkable downtown"", access is now challenging for me. I need to park within a block or two of my destination. 

The trend seems to be to put parking around the periphery of a large walkable area, and to discourage driving all together. The number and distribution of handicapped parking spaces is woefully inadequate. Public transportation can't get me close enough, especially during those times when streets are closed off, which of course are exactly the times I'd like to go downtown and eat dinner or enjoy some entertainment.

I feel invisible to the powers that be. We seem to be aiming for a city center designed for the young and able-bodied. About 4.5% of Washtenaw County residents are mobility challenged. The ADA is supposed to protect our access to public places. That's not happening here.

What can be done to surface this issue to the the powers that be? Or is it too late? It seems like Chris Taylor and his toadie council have a long-term lock on how Ann Arbor is developing, and no one who thinks differently has a voice. (Yes, I am a admittedly somewhat bitter.)

I'm particularly interested in hearing from other mobility challenged people about how they access downtown Ann Arbor. I'm pretty newly disabled, so maybe I am missing some resources or solutions.

Or maybe I'm just an old fogy who needs to shut up and find a more accessible city center somewhere else?

Edit: no one needs to make any more comments about my characterization of Chris Taylor and the city council. I got everyone's message, for sure. I think I'm a little reactive because of the recent election, and I wasn't thoughtful about my comments. I apologize to everyone who was offended or otherwise put off. I don't want my careless language to detract from a very useful discussion about how people who are not able-bodied can better enjoy our town.",301,308.0,1731171129.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/,post7.json

So if you actually *need* to get wherever you're going on time, like a doctor's appointment, make sure to schedule your A-Ride for at least 30 minutes earlier than you'd think (which is still unequal access- I just Uber/Lyft to doctors because I don't have the mental energy to sift through all my appointments/errands and deliberate on which ones I can afford to be late to and which ones I can't.

The idea I was responding to here was not adding bike lanes or making more streets more pedestrian friendly, but rather converting all downtown parking to handicapped only.

I really hope that when the new affordable development on Catherine St opens that all the rest of the street parking adjacent to the farmers market gets turned into a mix of 15 minute drop off spots or handicapped parking. I’m more than happy to walk two blocks when I drive to the market because I can.",25,,1731178448.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lwafteo/,post7.json

comment,lwbcgrp,t3_1gneciq,bobi2393,AnnArbor,,"""All my life, I've enjoyed going downtown to shop, dine, visit the library, see a movie, etc. No longer.""

Looking at the downtown parking map ([link](https://www.a2dda.org/getting-around/drive/), click the square in the upper right of of the small map to enlarge), there are parking lots or parking structures within two blocks of almost everything downtown, except maybe around city hall, which isn't really an entertainment/dining area. There's also random street parking scattered about. Liberty Square parking structure is almost adjacent to Michigan Theater, and a block and a half from the State Theater, while the library has a massive underground parking structure right next to it. Those two examples in particular seem odd to single out, unless you're opposed to parking structures. They have elevators, and personally I haven't noticed a shortage of handicap spaces in them, although I haven't had reason to seek them out for a few years.

I'm sympathetic to your limitations, but there's only so much that's realistic. On days that two blocks is too far to walk, I think it's reasonable to expect you to adapt more than the city to adapt. Maybe that means getting an electric wheelchair or mobility scooter, or using ride-share/taxi services to drop and pick you in front of where you want to go.

One suggestion I didn't see listed elsewhere, which *might* be useful situationally, is May Mobility, an autonomous driving company headquartered in Ann Arbor. They're testing robotaxis in five cities with safety drivers behind the wheel to take over in case the software has a problem, and have limited hours of operation, but offer free service to quite a few specific locations downtown. (They won't stop in the middle of traffic, like human drivers do, for illicit pickups and dropoffs). Currently service in Ann Arbor is free, operating 9am-4pm Monday through Friday. Here's a [link](https://maymobility.com/locations/ann-arbor-mi/) to their Ann Arbor operations, with a rough map of their service area. The area is now a bit larger than the website shows; the app's map is up to date. It covers roughly around Main &amp; Stadium to Packard &amp; Stadium on the south, to Main &amp; Fuller at the northwest, and Ann &amp; Observatory at the northeast (it doesn't cover the medical center). Search for ""May Mobility app"" on your phone ([Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/may-mobility/id1635037304), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ridewithvia.maymobility.grandrapids.av&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US)).",28,,1731189108.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lwbcgrp/,post7.json

If I have to park in a spot that's far from the elevator, that's one of my two blocks right there, just to get down to the street.

I went to Burns Park elementary as a kid. At that time, Burns Park was actually a racially integrated neighborhood, because there was a big mix of housing and some of it was very affordable. Then the area began to gentrify, and what didn't gentrify got converted to student housing. The neighborhood lost its diversity. 

I could also go to the art fair and actually afford the art. It was only three blocks long.

I could buy student tickets for the end zone at the big house for 5 bucks for the football games. 

I watched Iggy Pop slime across the Huron high School stage during talent competitions. I listened to Bob seger play the free rock concerts.

I could go on and on and I would just further reveal my age, lol.

I can't remember what year it was, maybe the year that M14 was completed and Ann Arbor became a viable bedroom community for people who worked in or near Detroit. I remember asking, ""who are all these yuppies and what are they doing in my town?"".

We destroyed the historically black neighborhoods downtown, appropriating the schools there for the kids of wealthy white folks, and then we moved on to the Mack school neighborhood and did the same. That is, we destroyed a lot of affordable housing and never replaced it.

I don't feel we ever had a truly open and inclusive debate about what size town we wanted to be and what character we wanted it to have. Instead we just had competing visions for growth, between Republicans and Democrats, until Republicans utterly disappeared from Ann Arbor, and the Democratic machine took over.

But I suspect your whole ""Taylor's machine"" is about something else. They've been receptive to people's needs in commercial districtes including downtown.

Yes, more handicap spaces, especially on the street so we can park nearer to our destination. 

I'm definitely not against street closures for restaurants, just want a way to navigate to my destination when that happens. Perhaps a booper-like service that was free or low cost for the disabled.

Another idea: We have zip cars, shareable bicycles, shareable scooters. Why not shareable mobility vehicles like most grocery stores have? If those were available at the periphery of the closed area, that would be extremely helpful! Not everyone who could benefit from such a vehicle can afford to buy a personal one.

comment,lx528ax,t1_lx4xzt3,MichUrbanGardener,AnnArbor,,"FYI, I recently asked Ann Arbor police what I should do if someone is parked in a handicap spot and apparently not allowed to be. They said they cannot ticket based on a photograph or any information I might call in. They said if you call the non-emergency number and report it, they make every effort to get out there quickly to ticket the offending individual. If you have the license plate number and they are lucky enough to see a phone number associated with it, they will call and speak to the person involved. 

I have also started carrying small notes in my dashboard. When I find someone parked in a spot without displaying proper credentials, I put the note on their windshield. It's politely worded but does not hide my ire at an able-bodied person taking a space a less able-bodied person needs.

PS The revenue impact in fact was probably negligible. Someone else took your space and ate downtown. 

I'm going to put on my list to have the parking contractor more regularly check handicap parking spaces. I think it might be good to very publicly crack down on these. Maybe even raise the ticket fee. If a few people have to pay several hundred dollars, maybe behaviors will change.",2,,1731614544.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lx528ax/,post7.json

comment,lwbwxif,t3_1gneciq,Objective-Bug-1941,AnnArbor,,"My spouse started using a wheelchair 2 years ago, and our time spent downtown has been greatly reduced for the reasons you described. When I brought this issue to people's attention, I was told I'm a pro-car anti-environment Karen, which isn't who I am.

At least now I know we're not the only family basically shut out of downtown.

Yes, there is accessible parking, but 9 times out of 10, they're taken. Mostly by cars with tags or plates, but sometimes not. 

So we typically go out to surrounding areas to places with parking lots, with spots in front of businesses and restaurants.

I'm from New York. I love walkable or rollable areas. I love downtown Ann Arbor, but it's getting more difficult to justify the expense and energy spent to patronize downtown.

There's been a disturbing trend in cities that in order to make things more ""walkable"" or bike-friendly"", people with disabilities are left out of the conversation. See NY's DOT roundtable with members of the community in Spring 2023 that included several people representing corporations or organizations sued/still being sued for ADA violations, but not one representative from a disabilty-related organization or agency.

This summer, we thought about attending the A2 200 party, then doing lunch and some shopping
I looked at the map, and there were two blue spaces right on the half of the street that wasn't closed. Yet when we got there, a city vehicle was parked on the first one, no symbol on the plate, no hang tag on the mirror. The second one was behind a barricade. I unloaded my spouse, then parked the car on another block. When we got to the party, there was a booth and some activities on the lower level. How do we get down there? The ramp was blocked by equipment for the stage area. The only option was to go around the corner and access from the back. It was obvious that no one who set up the event was cognizant that people with disabilities might want to check out all of the event, not just some of it. So we left the party and left downtown for lunch and shopping.

When we tried to get A-Ride to get my spouse places, we were told we didn't qualify, and a social worker admonished us for trying to steal resources from people who really need them. Like yes, we have a crappy car, but it's not equipped to easily get in and out of in a wheelchair and we can't afford to either add a lift or get our own van. 

I think for all the talk people talk in this town, no one wants to walk the walk or roll the roll in our case.",10,,1731196229.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lwbwxif/,post7.json

I don't enjoy biking here nearly as much as where I moved from, even with the current bike lane infrastructure. Ann Arbor is not a very walkable city either. 

There is actually a lot of inexpensive parking for cars, even in front of most downtown restaurants. Spots may not always be free, but I found driving around the block a time or two often leads to parking within a block of my destination, except during peak times or when there is a home game or a festival. 

Maybe I'm just lucky but the times when I've driven to the farmers market on a Saturday I've always found parking next to the market.

Ann Arbor is actually hard for people in wheel chairs etc because it's an old city that's never really been updated for pedestrian travel and is dominated by cars. Spend some time in a pedestrian friendly city and you will actually find it's much easier for people with disabilities to get around.",9,,1731209802.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lwcxash/,post7.json
comment,lwc7o7n,t3_1gneciq,chriswaco,AnnArbor,,"We go downtown far less often than we used to because of traffic, road closures, abysmal traffic light timing, and the lack of street parking in favor of bike lanes. Maybe one day people will ride their bikes more often, but I was downtown for an hour this afternoon and didn't see a single one. Last time I saw maybe one or two. And this is when the weather was perfect on a Saturday afternoon, not in the middle of winter.      
      
My wife can't walk more than a block or two so I wind up dropping her off nearby and then park on my own. It's easier for us to go to Saline so we've started doing that more often.",1,,1731200060.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lwc7o7n/,post7.json

Why have older generations not planned for aging? You've been in charge for a long time, you knew one day this would happen.

It's like a lot of things lately in our society. How many decades have people voted not to fix infrastructure and when we finally get a president dumping hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure all people do is moan about the construction. 

President Carter 5 decades ago set in motion all the things we are trying to desperately catch up on today with alternative energy solutions. We all knew this was coming.

All the seniors who can't get downtown. Where are your kids? Why can't they help you? 

We moved here to take care of my wife's parents. I have no desire to live in Michigan, but they have done so much for us from the time our son was born and throughout the years I see helping them when most in need a higher cause than my wants at this time.",2,,1731200690.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lwc9e81/,post7.json

comment,lwvelyr,t1_lwv2sr0,MichUrbanGardener,AnnArbor,,"Yes, thank you, I already realized I inappropriately commingled the two. And yes, I have become steadily more disabled over the past several years after a life of being very active in ways that aren't very accessible to me now. 

I have never meant to imply that the solution is for me to be able to park within two blocks of where I want to go. What I was suggesting was that large areas designed primarily to accommodate biking and walking may not be very accessible to people who can do neither. The emphasis on these two attributes of public spaces, without mention of accessibility, makes me feel unwelcome. 

As you can see from other posts on this thread, I am not the only one who feels this way. Many of us who were able-bodied until we weren't don't know where to turn to learn about resources, or to draw attention to lack of same.

And then you have things like confronted the gentleman who tried to take his wife to an event downtown. She was wheelchair bound, and someone had set up the stage in the corridor that was supposed to provide wheelchair access.

You sound like you have some experience with disability advocacy. I'm sure you have a lot of experience with frustrations that are new to me, like somebody able-bodied parked in a handicap parking spot, or someone carelessly blocking access for people who need a ramp or a railing or whatever. Or bikes and scooters and cars readily available for public use and sharing, but nary a mobility scooter in sight. Like not having a place for blocks at a time to sit and rest for a moment. 

This post has been very eye-opening and informative for me. It's given me a lot of things to think about, and some things to try. So, any mistakes I may have made in tone or content I can live with. Ditto the trolls who think I equate concerns about walkability and bike ability with being car-centric, when nothing could be further from the truth.",2,,1731474051.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lwvelyr/,post7.json
comment,lwv2sr0,t3_1gneciq,Gullible-Poet-3457,AnnArbor,,"I understand your frustration, and I realize that you’re new to having mobility issues. Nevertheless, a few suggestions from someone with a lifelong mobility disability

prioritizing accessibility often means increasing access for the \*most\* people. This may not always include or accommodate your specific preferences (parking on the first floor of a parking structure, for example). There are currently \*many\* inexpensive parking garages within 2 blocks of the downtown core, all of them with the correct ratio of regular-to-accessible parking. Other posters have also mentioned DDA’s slated increase on accessible street parking. Until that time, you have a few options

Talk to your doctor about getting mobility aids (many of which will be covered to some extent by insurance). If you have difficulty walking more than a block, the answer is not being able to drive within a few steps of where you need to be. That’s impractical in all but the most suburban settings. Nor is it something many people active in the disability rights sphere would support (The focus is rightly on increasing public transit options, since that is the most affordable, environmental option that serves the most people).

Get involved in ongoing efforts to improve accessibility in the city (I won’t repeat what others have already said in the comments, but there are some great suggestions). Listen to the people who have been involved in this space for years. I’d also recommend separating out your frustrations with changes to Ann Arbor from your frustrations with accessibility.",1,,1731468978.0,https://reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lwv2sr0/,post7.json

comment,lwa2u08,t3_1gneciq,ginkgodave,AnnArbor,,"I’m in exactly the same situation. The city puts a lot of emphasis on walkability… for young able bodied people.

People whine about wanting more expensive public transportation and expensive bike friendly transit. My taxes support transit, bike lanes and street closures, yet I either can’t or without difficulty use of them and because of that it’s very hard for me to even park within my limited ability to walk to a restaurant. 

The city closes downtown streets that make it extra hard for people with disabilities to access those areas to do the same things that able bodied people don’t think twice about doing. 

I’ve lived and worked in the city since 1972. I biked to work daily for 21years. Kept an old house on the tax rolls. Paid a fuck ton of taxes.  Voted for liberal Democrats when there used to some. I’ve paid my dues.

All I want is to be able to park close enough to hobble my way a block or two to a decent downtown restaurant. Is that too much to ask? 

I guess my money isn’t good enough. Old and in the way in Michigan’s supposedly most progressive city.
