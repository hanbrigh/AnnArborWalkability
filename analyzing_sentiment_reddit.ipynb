         "I think Church Street works because its central to a dense and already walkable city. It is part of the main shopping/commercial area of the city and city hall opens right onto it (with the park literally right there, too). Small New England cities are pretty condensed; if you're going to hit up the farmers market at the park, may as well walk down church street and check it out. Stop by a brewery around the corner, head down to the lakefront. An able bodied person doesn't need a car or even a bus pass to see the city in a day. Its honestly more of a pain to drive than walk.\n\nThat's said, there are a few pedestrian streets/alleys in Detroit that are really lovely, so they can work in bigger cities, too. I was just at Columbia Street next to the Fox Theater and it reminded me a lot of church street. Maybe the difference is that both are often people's final destinations and dont require car traffic to drive business. I think pedestrian malls can add a lovely sense of place and community, and their value isn't just commercial. Its a shame so many have failed.\n\nIm obviously biased because I absolutely loved living in Burlington. But theres lots to think about here!",

         "Yes.  Kalamzoo Mall north of Michigan Ave is still a fully closed to vehicles ped mall and it's far less active than the part you mention to the south.\n\nPearl Street and Church Streets mentioned above are both in cold climates with snow.  I've been to Church street in the winter time and there is a constant level of programming (ice sculptures, music, lights, etc.) to keep it active and vibrant feeling, and even then it seems to struggle at times.\n\nI'm fully on board with the need to improve pedestrian comfort, widen sidewalks, manage vehicle speeds, etc. but that doesn't require jumping all the way up \"make it a ped mall!\" to have a major impact.  5th Street in Kerrytown, First &amp; Liberty, etc. are examples of pedestrian-centric street design changes that still allow vehicles but are vastly more comfortable for pedestrians than they were.  The circulation study looks to recommending a lot more of those types of treatments too.",

         "I think Church Street works because its central to a dense and already walkable city. It is part of the main shopping/commercial area of the city and city hall opens right onto it (with the park literally right there, too). Small New England cities are pretty condensed; if you're going to hit up the farmers market at the park, may as well walk down church street and check it out. Stop by a brewery around the corner, head down to the lakefront. An able bodied person doesn't need a car or even a bus pass to see the city in a day. Its honestly more of a pain to drive than walk.\n\nThat's said, there are a few pedestrian streets/alleys in Detroit that are really lovely, so they can work in bigger cities, too. I was just at Columbia Street next to the Fox Theater and it reminded me a lot of church street. Maybe the difference is that both are often people's final destinations and dont require car traffic to drive business. I think pedestrian malls can add a lovely sense of place and community, and their value isn't just commercial. Its a shame so many have failed.\n\nIm obviously biased because I absolutely loved living in Burlington. But theres lots to think about here!",

It is part of the main shopping/commercial area of the city and city hall opens right onto it (with the park literally right there, too). Small New England cities are pretty condensed; if you're going to hit up the farmers market at the park, may as well walk down church street and check it out. Stop by a brewery around the corner, head down to the lakefront. An able bodied person doesn't need a car or even a bus pass to see the city in a day. Its honestly more of a pain to drive than walk.\n\nThat's said, there are a few pedestrian streets/alleys in Detroit that are really lovely, so they can work in bigger cities, too. I was just at Columbia Street next to the Fox Theater and it reminded me a lot of church street. Maybe the difference is that both are often people's final destinations and dont require car traffic to drive business. I think pedestrian malls can add a lovely sense of place and community, and their value isn't just commercial. Its a shame so many have failed.\n\nIm obviously biased because I absolutely loved living in Burlington. But theres lots to think about here!",

Kalamzoo Mall north of Michigan Ave is still a fully closed to vehicles ped mall and it's far less active than the part you mention to the south.\n\nPearl Street and Church Streets mentioned above are both in cold climates with snow.  I've been to Church street in the winter time and there is a constant level of programming (ice sculptures, music, lights, etc.) to keep it active and vibrant feeling, and even then it seems to struggle at times.\n\nI'm fully on board with the need to improve pedestrian comfort, widen sidewalks, manage vehicle speeds, etc. but that doesn't require jumping all the way up \"make it a ped mall!\" to have a major impact.  5th Street in Kerrytown, First &amp; Liberty, etc. are examples of pedestrian-centric street design changes that still allow vehicles but are vastly more comfortable for pedestrians than they were.  The circulation study looks to recommending a lot more of those types of treatments too.",
