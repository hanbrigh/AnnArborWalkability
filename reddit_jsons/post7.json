(They won't stop in the middle of traffic, like human drivers do, for illicit pickups and dropoffs). Currently service in Ann Arbor is free, operating 9am-4pm Monday through Friday.

See NY&amp;#39;s DOT roundtable with members of the community in Spring 2023 that included several people representing corporations or organizations sued/still being sued for ADA violations, but not one representative from a disabilty-related organization or agency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This summer, we thought about attending the A2 200 party, then doing lunch and some shopping\nI looked at the map, and there were two blue spaces right on the half of the street that wasn&amp;#39;t closed. Yet when we got there, a city vehicle was parked on the first one, no symbol on the plate, no hang tag on the mirror. The second one was behind a barricade. I unloaded my spouse, then parked the car on another block. When we got to the party, there was a booth and some activities on the lower level. How do we get down there? The ramp was blocked by equipment for the stage area. The only option was to go around the corner and access from the back. It was obvious that no one who set up the event was cognizant that people with disabilities might want to check out all of the event, not just some of it. So we left the party and left downtown for lunch and shopping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we tried to get A-Ride to get my spouse places, we were told we didn&amp;#39;t qualify, and a social worker admonished us for trying to steal resources from people who really need them. Like yes, we have a crappy car, but it&amp;#39;s not equipped to easily get in and out of in a wheelchair and we can&amp;#39;t afford to either add a lift or get our own van. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think for all the talk people talk in this town, no one wants to walk the walk or roll the roll in our case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AnnArbor/comments/1gneciq/i_feel_shut_out_of_downtown/lwbwxif/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1731196229.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1gneciq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AnnArbor", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5tm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AnnArbor", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "qpr09aqn8qb305dcbae1e466c761a022e6be19c3072b75aeb2", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5tm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AnnArbor", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "qpr09aqn8qb305dcbae1e466c761a022e6be19c3072b75aeb2", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5tm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AnnArbor", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "qpr09aqn8qb305dcbae1e466c761a022e6be19c3072b75aeb2", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5tm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AnnArbor", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "lwerare", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "tazmodious", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_lwe8h7f", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_bqpx92q6", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Yes, it's a shame.
